35 stagnation point blunt body hypersonic flow li,t.y. geiger,r.e. j. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 25. purpose paper to present method calculation devised to yield important information on symmetric inviscid hypersonic flow stagnation point region blunt body problem same that considered by hayes used slightly different approach demonstrated that hayes' results valid stagnation point region can hence considered basis constructing less restricted solutions equations presented giving velocity, pressure, detachment distance, vorticity values shock detachment distance body pressure coefficient compared experimental data spheres pressure comparison shows that results hayes theory presented herein represent better approximation than newtonian impact theory hypersonic mach numbers conclusion, possibility refinements to analysis discussed
