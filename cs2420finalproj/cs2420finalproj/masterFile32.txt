32 dynamic motion missile descending through atmosphere friedrich,h.r. dore,f.j. j. ae. scs. 22, 1955, 628. method presented computing rapidly, yet accurately, dynamic motion ballistic-type missile descending through atmosphere equations motion separated into set /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle attack) set /rotational/ equations describing oscillatory motion missile about center gravity transformation allows rotational equations to written manner analogous to equation undamped oscillating spring mass system mass equal to unity time variable spring constant given initial conditions equation can solved to obtain envelope maximum angle attack additional transformation allows calculation complete oscillatory motion at time during trajectory function maximum angle attack at that time solution shows that maximum angle attack missile descending through atmosphere at relatively constant speed reduced even aerodynamic damping neglected
