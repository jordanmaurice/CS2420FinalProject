16 transformation compressible turbulent boundary layer mager,a. j. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 305. transformation compressible turbulent boundarylayer equations to their incompressible equivalent demonstrated analytically transformation essentially same that laminar layer, first given by stewartson, except that explicit relation between viscosity temperature not required key point analysis modification stream function to include mean fluctuating components postulate that apparent turbulent shear, associated elemental mass, remains invariant transformation values incompressible friction coefficients pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good agreement experimentally measured independently reported results application transformation to self-preserving boundary layers to computations general boundary-layer flow shown
