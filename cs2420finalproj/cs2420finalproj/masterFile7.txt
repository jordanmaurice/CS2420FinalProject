7 effect controlled three-dimensional roughness on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds van driest,e.r. mccauley,w.d. j. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 261. experiments were performed 12-in. supersonic wind tunnel jet propulsion laboratory california institute technology to investigate effect three-dimensional roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on tained at local mach numbers 1.90, 2.71, 3.67 by varying trip size, position, spacing, reynolds number per inch results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins double row spiral vortices trailing each element contaminates breaks down surrounding field vorticity, (2) transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent increasing roughness height relative to boundary-layer thickness, (3) after breakdown vorticity field, strength spiral vortices may still persist sublayer ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing roughness elements has little effect upon initial breakdown (contamination) laminar flow, (5) trip reynolds number where u v velocity kinematic viscosity at outer edge boundary layer k roughness height, such that transition occurs at roughness position, varies position reynolds number to one-fourth power, viz., where x trip position
