18 flow field diffuser radial compressor rhyming,i.l. j. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 798. note discusses two-dimensional diffuser flow field radial compressor outside impeller wheel assumed that diffuser has guide vanes arranged circular row at radius impeller wheel has radius (see fig. 1) flow diffuser starts at circle radius velocity components, r directions velocity vector on circle prescribed together thermal state gas flow so prescribed on radius will, if no disturbances present (i.e., no boundary conditions flow other than zero velocity at infinity to fulfilled), develop spiral flow
