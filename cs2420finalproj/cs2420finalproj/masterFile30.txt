30 photo-thermoelastic investigation transient thermal stresses multiweb wing structure gerard,g. tramposch,h. j. ae. scs. 26, 1959, 783. photothermoelastic experiments were performed on long multiweb wing model which theoretical analysis available literature experimental procedures utilized to simulate conditions prescribed theory fully described correlation theory experiment terms dimensionless temperature, stress, time, biot number revealed that theory predicted values higher than experimentally observed maximum thermal stresses at center web detailed temperature measurements flange suggested that major source discrepancy can traced to one-dimensional heat conduction analysis flange employed theory
