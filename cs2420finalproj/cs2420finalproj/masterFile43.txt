43 relation between wall temperature effect roughness on boundary layer transition potter,j.l. whitfield,j.d. j. ae. scs. 28, 1961, 663. experimentally demonstrated rise subsequent fall transition reynolds number decreasing wall-toambient temperature ratio has subject two recent notes both cases argued that increased effectiveness roughness due to wall cooling not sufficient to explain transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smooth bodies one case, criterion transition reversal taken to other values low eter reynolds number formed from velocity kinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at height roughness element k undisturbed, laminar boundary layer at station roughness location present note submitted to show that another method evaluating effect roughness on transition leads to opposite conclusion
