23 skin-friction heat transfer characteristics laminar boundary layer on cylinder axial incompressible flow seban,r.a. bond,r. j. ae. scs. 18, 1951, 671. solution given case laminar boundary layer incompressible fluid constant properties on exterior cylinder flow parallel to cylinder axis case differs from blasius solution flow along flat plate by considering effect curvature plane transverse to flow direction local skin-friction heat-transfer coefficients prandtl number 0.715 evaluated compared to similar magnitudes flat plate flow, effect curvature shown to significant practical cases recovery factors evaluated, quantity found to insensitive to effect curvature boundary
