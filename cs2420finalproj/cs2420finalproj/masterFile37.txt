37 new technique investigating heat transfer surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions ferri,a. libby,p.a. j. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 464. on forebody practically interesting hypersonic vehicles, there little interaction between inviscid flow field boundary layer therefore, inviscid flow theory can used to determine, independent surface phenomena, physically interesting quantities such shock shape, shock detachment distance, sonic line shape, pressure distribution furthermore, pressure distribution so determined can then used study heat transfer, materials behavior, other surface phenomena thus, these bodies, prandtl boundary-layer concept can utilized calculation both inviscid flow boundary-layer behavior purpose note to point out that concept can also applied experimentally order to provide, conjunction conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, means investigating hypersonic heat transfer surface phenomena under conditions flight reynolds numbers
