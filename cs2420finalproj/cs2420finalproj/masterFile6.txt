6 one-dimensional transient heat flow multilayer slab campbell,w.f. j. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 340. recent contribution to readers' forum wassermann gave analytic solutions temperature double layer slab, triangular heat rate input at one face, insulated at other, no thermal resistance at interface solutions were three particular cases.. propose to give general solution to problem, to indicate briefly obtained using method reference 2, to point out that solutions given by wassermann incomplete times longer than duration heat input
