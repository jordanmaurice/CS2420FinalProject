49 temperature velocity profiles compressible laminar boundary layer arbitrary distribution surface temperature chapman,d. rubesin,m. j. ae. scs. 16, 1949, 547. analysis presented which enables temperature profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, skin friction to calculated laminar flow over two-dimensional axially symmetric surface without pressure gradient arbitrary analytic distribution surface temperature general theory applicable to gas prandtl number, although numerical results given herein computed air predictions theory special case constant surface temperature compared calculations crocco on basis comparison, inferred that present theory enables heat-transfer skin-friction calculations accurate to within about 5 per cent to made flight conditions up to mach numbers near 5 to within about 1 2 per cent supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher mach numbers particular effort has made to present results, which simple considering their generality, form that can used readily practical applications from mathematical point view, theory applicable to arbitrary analytic distribution surface temperature, given practical case necessary that surface-temperature distribution approximated by polynomial only unknowns final equations developed coefficients polynomial, so that work involved applying theory given case depends entirely on work involved approximating given surfacetemperature distribution by polynomial example worked out detail which illustrates principal effects variable surface temperature shown that both positively infinite negatively infinite heat-transfer coefficients can occur anomaly infinite negative heat-transfer coefficients discussed attributed to customary definition heat-transfer coefficient, which shown to fundamentally inappropriate flows variable surface temperature particular example considered, conventional method calculating net heat transferred yields completely incorrect results brief qualitative discussion possible effects heat transfer on flow separation given order to facilitate use results, principal equations developed collected summarized section entitled /practical use results ./
