14 piston theory - new aerodynamic tool aeroelastician ashley,h. zartarian,g. j. ae. scs. 23, 1956, 1109. representative applications described which illustrate extent to which simplifications solutions high-speed unsteady aeroelastic problems can achieved through use certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively /piston theory ./ based on physical model originally proposed by hayes lighthill, piston theory airfoils finite wings has systematically developed by landahl, utilizing expansions powers thickness ratio inverse flight mach number m contributions orders negligible, theory predicts point-function relationship between local pressure on surface wing normal component fluid velocity produced by wing's motion computation generalized forces aeroelastic equations, such flutter determinant, then always reduced to elementary integrations assumed modes motion essentially closed-form solutions given bendingtorsion control-surface flutter properties typical section airfoils at high mach numbers these agree well results more exact theories wherever comparisons can fairly made moreover, demonstrate increasingly important influence thickness profile shape m grows larger, discovery that would almost impossible using other available aerodynamic tools complexity more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on three-dimensional wings panels-is shown to substantially reduced by piston theory iterative procedure outlined, by which improved flutter eigenvalues can found through successive introduction higher-order terms other applications to unsteady supersonic problems reviewed, including gust response rapid maneuvers elastic aircraft steady-state aeroelastic calculations also discussed, piston theory amounts only to slight modification ackeret's formulas suggestions made regarding future research based on new aerodynamic method, particular emphasis on areas where computational labor can reduced minimum loss precision pointed out that mach number zone exists where thermal effects appreciable nonlinear viscous interactions may neglected, that zone piston theory logical way estimating air loads analyzing aerodynamic-thermoelastic interaction problems
