39 on flow sonic stream past airfoil surface sinnott,c.s. j.ae.scs. 26, 1959, 169. study flow about airfoil near-sonic stream indicates important factors determining pressure distribution on airfoil analysis mach wave pattern suggests that supersonic domain flow can derived from two simple-wave flows, one arising from mach waves reflected at sonic line other from changes airfoil surface slope compressive effect reflected mach waves determined quantitatively function airfoil leading-edge geometry from analysis measured pressure distributions uncambered airfoils,. shown can superimposed on wave system from curved surface to give equivalent simple-wave flow over airfoil application scheme to calculation pressure distribution over airfoil sonic stream gives results good agreement experiment
