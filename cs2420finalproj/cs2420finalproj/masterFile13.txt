13 similarity laws stressing heated wings tsien,h.s. j. ae. scs. 20, 1953, 1. shown that differential equations heated plate large temperature gradient similar plate at constant temperature can made same by proper modification thickness loading isothermal plate fact leads to result that stresses heated plate can calculated from measured strains on unheated plate by series relations, called /similarity laws ./ application analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic heating discussed detail loading on unheated analog wing is, however, complicated involves novel concept feedback /body force/ loading problem stressing heated box-wing structure can solved by same analog method briefly discussed
