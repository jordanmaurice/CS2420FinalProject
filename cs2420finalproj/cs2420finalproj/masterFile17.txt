17 remarks on eddy viscosity compressible mixing flows lu ting paul a. libby polytechnic institute brooklyn, general applied science laboratories, inc. connection study wakes behind bodies hypersonic flow carried out missile space vehicle division general electric company, desired to estimate eddy viscosity axisymmetric, compressible wakes because lack applicable experimental data, found necessary to make such estimate by rationally extending available data incompressible flows to compressible case suggested application extension transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers reference infinitesimal mass invariant transformation, mager showed that partial differential equations compressible turbulent boundary layer can transformed to incompressible form validity assumption transformations established several boundary-layer flows by comparison experiment
