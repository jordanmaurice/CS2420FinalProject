45 investigation separated flows, part ii: flow cavity heat transfer charwat,a.f. j. ae. scs. 28, 1961, 513. first portion paper describes studies internal structure separated flow notch at free-stream mach number 3 observations include.. flow visualization, sparkschlieren pictures fluctuations free shear layer, studies diffusion heat from sources placed separated region second part describes measurements local heat transfer to wall external mach number, length-to-depth ratio cavity, ratio oncoming boundary layer thickness to notch depth (in turbulent flow region), thermal-tomomentum thickness ratio boundary layer and, finally, geometry internal boundary separated region varied systematically possible on basis these observations, simple model flow heat transfer across separated region formulated
