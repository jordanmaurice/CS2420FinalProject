24 theory stagnation point heat transfer dissociated air fay,j.a. riddell,f.r. j. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 73. boundary-layer equations developed general case very high speed flight where external flow dissociated state particular effects diffusion atom recombination boundary layer included shown that at stagnation point equations can reduced exactly to set nonlinear ordinary differential equations even chemical reactions proceed so slowly that boundary layer not thermochemical equilibrium two methods numerical solution these stagnation point equations presented, one equilibrium case other nonequilibrium case numerical results correlated terms parameters entering numerical formulation so not to depend critically on physical assumptions made nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to atom recombination) noncatalytic wall surfaces considered solution represented which shows transition from /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination rates) to equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) recombination rate parameter introduced to interpret nonequilibrium results, shown that scale factor involved relating equilibrium state boundary layer on bodies different sizes concluded that heat transfer through equilibrium stagnation point boundary layer can computed accurately by simple correlation formula that heat transfer almost unaffected by nonequilibrium state boundary layer provided wall catalytic lewis number near unity
