1 experimental investigation aerodynamics wing slipstream brenckman,m. j. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 324. experimental study wing propeller slipstream made order to determine spanwise distribution lift increase due to slipstream at different angles attack wing at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios results were intended part evaluation basis different theoretical treatments problem comparative span loading curves, together supporting evidence, showed that substantial part lift increment produced by slipstream due to /destalling/ boundary-layer-control effect integrated remaining lift increment, after subtracting destalling lift, found to agree well potential flow theory empirical evaluation destalling effects made specific configuration experiment
