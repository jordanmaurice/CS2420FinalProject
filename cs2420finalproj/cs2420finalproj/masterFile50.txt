50 investigation laminar boundary layer compressible fluids using crocco method van driest,e.r. naca tn.2597, 1952. present investigation flow air thin laminar boundary layer on flat plate, crocco method has used to solve simultaneous differential equations momentum energy involved such flow crocco method used because gave accurate results arbitrary prandtl number near unity prandtl number taken at 0.75, specific heat held constant, sutherland law viscosity-temperature variation assumed to represent viscosity data starting initial ambient temperature -67.6 f main results presented skinfriction heat-transfer coefficients functions reynolds number, mach number, wall-to-free-stream temperature ratio variations shear, velocity, temperature, mach number across boundary layer included crocco method discussed detail
