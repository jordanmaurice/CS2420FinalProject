44 tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85. bertram,m.h. j.ae.scs. 23, 1956,898. there is, at present, considerable interest characteristies blunted bodies from both aerodynamic heat-transfer standpoint use blunt shapes contemplated to reduce heat-transfer problem at body noses, there also applications blunt noses which occur from mainly aerodynamic considerations actual reduction drag may beneficial result blunting nose cone similar slender shape under certain conditions although sphere has received considerable treatment, nose shapes not necessarily tangent spheres case, let say, total head tube situated nose given body, blunting may quite flat, nose sections blunter than spherical shape may conceivably desirable, cases, from heattransfer standpoint purpose present investigation to examine aerodynamic effect simple type nose blunting on basic body incompressible flow electrically conducting fluid past porous plate y = 0 constant suction velocity presence transverse uniform strength has recently investigated by gupta note, problem generalized to take into account effect free convection, body force g per unit mass acting negative x-direction parallel to wall fluid assumed to semi-incompressible usual addition to obvious practical significance, problem also interesting sense that provides another exact solution magnetohydrodynamic equations, since only electromagnetic assumptions involved constant properties freedom from excessive charges
