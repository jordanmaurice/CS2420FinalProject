29 simple model study transient temperature thermal stress distribution due to aerodynamic heating isakson,g. j. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 611. present work concerned determination transient temperatures thermal stresses simple models intended to simulate parts whole aircraft structure builtup variety subjected to aerodynamic heating first case considered that convective heat transfer into one side flat plate, representing thick skin, effect resulting temperature distribution inducing thermal stresses associated bending restraint at plate edges numerical results presented transient temperature differentials plate environment temperature first increases linearly time then remains constant, period linear increase representing time acceleration aircraft corresponding thermal stress information presented second case that wide-flanged i-beam convective heat transfer into outer faces flanges numerical results presented transient temperature differentials wide range values applicable parameters environment temperature variation described above corresponding thermal stresses beam infinite length determined theoretical analysis stress distribution beam finite length carried out numerical results obtained one case experimental investigation temperatures stresses such beam described, results presented which indicate good agreement corresponding theoretical results
