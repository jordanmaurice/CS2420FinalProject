34 constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow kerrebrock,j.p. marble,f.e. j. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 78. course investigating boundary-layer flow continuous plasma accelerators crossed electric magnetic fields, found advantageous to at hand simple closed-form solutions magneto-gasdynamic flow duct which could serve free-stream conditions boundary layers nontrivial solutions sort not available at present, fact, work resler sears, variation conditions along flow axis must obtained through numerical integration consequently, simple solutions magneto-gasdynamic channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity to serve free-stream boundary conditions analytic investigations boundary layer physically reasonable accelerator particular, since cooling accelerator tube likely to important physical problem because high gas temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity, channel flow constant temperature appears interesting simple algebraic solutions case constant temperature plasma developed following paragraphs
