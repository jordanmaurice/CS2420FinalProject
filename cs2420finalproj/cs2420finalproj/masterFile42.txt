42 gyroscopic effect rigid rotating propeller on engine wing vibration modes scanlan,r.h. truman,j.c. j. ae. scs. 17, 1950, 653. wing vibration analyses found necessary to take into account effect flexibly mounted engines hence, reasonable to ask vibratory gyroscopic effect flexibility may give rise to propellers whirling engine mount may thought horizontal beam cantilevered from wing, having both horizontal vertical flexibility if beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, vibrated, gyroscopic moments induced propeller due to resultant pitching motion axis would not produce propeller axis yaw however, engine-mount lateral stiffness tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects play role propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at tip cantilever engine mount purpose paper to investigate role under assumption that propeller itself rigid disc paper divided into four parts part (1) deals briefly classical gyroscope theory part (2) presents engine vibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on model gyroscope mounted at ends two different cantilever beams part (3) presents theory coupled motion elastic wing upon which gyroscope mounted to simulate engine-propeller system on airplane part (4) consists example theory part (3), which, by taking thought to reasonable parameters, results obtained showing whirling rigid propeller may materially affect wing normal mode shapes frequencies
