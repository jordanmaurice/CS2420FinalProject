47 analysis low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures samson,s.h. bergmann,h.w. j. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 679. two methods presented analysis complex lowaspect-ratio aircraft structures both methods provide arbitrary external loading, general respect to orientation structural members, permit arbitrary boundary conditions purposes analysis structure idealized network flexural members interconnected torsion boxes first method, sets linear equations obtained by expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations, equilibrium requirements, slope-compatibility relationships terms deflections internal forces solution deflections internal forces then formed product inverse structural matrix column matrix load functions second method, conditions at given boundary assembled column matrix transferred step-bystep fashion over entire structure to opposite boundary transfer accomplished by successive multiplications square matrices composed independently different transfer ranges final operation inversion relatively small matrix provides solution unknown boundary conditions comparisons theoretical results experimental data electric-analog solutions favorable
