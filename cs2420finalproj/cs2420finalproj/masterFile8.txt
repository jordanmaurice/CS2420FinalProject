8 measurements effect two-dimensional three-dimensional roughness elements on boundary layer transition klebanoff,p.s. j. ae. scs. 22, 1955, 803. study effect roughness on transition, h. l. dryden found, on basis available data, that effect two-dimensional roughness element such /trip wire/ could represented reasonably well terms functional relation between and, where reynolds number transition based on distance from leading edge, height roughness element, boundary-layer displacement thickness at position element at suggestion additional data were obtained, primarily to extend range to higher values of, during course investigation transition on flat plate conducted at national bureau standards after results on twodimensional roughness elements were obtained, appeared to desirable to see whether row three-dimensional roughness elements would behave same way
