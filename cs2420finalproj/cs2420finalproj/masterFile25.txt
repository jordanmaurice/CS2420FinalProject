25 inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies lees,l. kubota,t. j. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 195. at hypersonic speeds drag area blunt nose much larger than drag area slender afterbody, energy contained flow field plane at right angles to flight direction nearly constant over downstream distance times greater than characteristic nose dimension transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly analogous to flow similarity behind intense blast wave found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, a. sakurai comparison experiments hammitt, vas, bogdonoff on flat plate blunt leading edge at helium shows that shock-wave shape predicted very accurately by similarity analysis predicted surface pressure distribution somewhat less satisfactory experimental results on hemisphere-cylinder obtained at galcit air tunnel indicate that not only shock-wave shape also surface pressures body given very closely by similarity theory, except near hemisphere-cylinder junction energy considerations combined detailed study equations motion show that flow similarity also possible class bodies form, provided that, where two-dimensional body body revolution shock shape not similar to body shape, entire flow field distance from nose must depend to extent on details nose geometry by again utilizing energy drag considerations one finds that at hypersonic speeds inviscid surface pressures generated by blunt leading edge larger than pressures induced by boundary-layer growth on insulated flat surface insulated blunt-nosed slender body revolution corresponding distance given by (here free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge thickness, nose diameter .) free flight these constants replaced by 1,700 20, respectively, so that viscous interaction effects important over forward portion bluntnosed slender body only relatively low values however, /far downstream/ nose inviscid over-pressure small viscous interaction phenomena to taken into account
