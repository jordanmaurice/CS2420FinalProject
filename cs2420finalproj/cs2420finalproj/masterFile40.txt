40 experiments on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds van driest,e.r. boison,j.c. j. ae. scs. 24, 1957, 885. tests were conducted 12-in. continuous supersonic wind tunnel jet propulsion laboratory, california institute technology, to determine effects surface cooling on boundary-layer transition at supersonic speeds effects cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers 1.97, smooth cone presence three levels supply-stream turbulence (0.4, 2, 9 per cent) several single-element roughnesses at fixed axial location transition data were obtained optically by means magnified-schlieren system results, range mach number investigated, indicate that (1) transition on smooth cone can definitely delayed by surface cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream turbulence surface roughness can also delayed by surface cooling depending upon degree turbulence relative roughness respectively, (3) adverse effects increased turbulence roughness decrease increasing mach number
