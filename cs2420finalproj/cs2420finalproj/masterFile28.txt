28 note on explosion solution sedov application to newtonian theory unsteady hypersonic flow freeman,n.c. j. ae. scs. 27, 1960, 77. exact analytical solution equations inviscid compressible unsteady flow has given by sedov (reference to solution may made through hayes probstein) solution similarity solution constant-energy point explosion view recent work on problems hypersonic flow limiting form ratio specific heats near 1 solution limit inquire form such solution would take einbinder, recent note, has examined solution various does not mention interesting case may shown that convergence to limit nonuniform over flow field also not difficult to show that nonuniform behavior exhibited that which one would expect from newtonian formulation derived reference 3
