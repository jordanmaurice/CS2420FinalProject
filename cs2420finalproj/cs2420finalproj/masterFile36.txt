36 supersonic flow around blunt bodies serbin,h. j. ae. scs. 25, 1958, 58. newtonian theory impact has shown to useful pressure calculations on forward facing part bodies moving at high speed now familiar practice to use information to calculate nonviscous velocities at wall then to estimate rates heat transfer procedure perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend on velocity gradients which not given by newtonian analysis nor can one obtain information on boundary-layer stability body stability derivatives seems, therefore, inevitable that, design proceeds these hypersonic missiles, there greater need more accurate aerodynamic theories either to predict happen unfamiliar flight conditions to effect extrapolation from known test result to design condition
