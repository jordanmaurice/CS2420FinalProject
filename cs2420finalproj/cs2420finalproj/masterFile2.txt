2 simple shear flow past flat plate incompressible fluid small viscosity ting-yili department aeronautical engineering, rensselaer polytechnic institute troy, n.y. study high-speed viscous flow past two-dimensional body usually necessary to consider curved shock wave emitting from nose leading edge body consequently, there exists inviscid rotational flow region between shock wave boundary layer such situation arises, instance, study hypersonic viscous flow past flat plate situation somewhat different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem prandtl's original problem inviscid free stream outside boundary layer irrotational while hypersonic boundary-layer problem inviscid free stream must considered rotational possible effects vorticity recently discussed by ferri libby present paper, simple shear flow past flat plate fluid small viscosity investigated can shown that problem can again treated by boundary-layer approximation, only novel feature being that free stream has constant vorticity discussion restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow
