9 transition studies skin friction measurements on insulated flat plate at mach number 5.8. korkegi,r.h. j. ae. scs. 23, 1956, 97. investigation transition skin friction on insulated flat plate, 5 by 26 in., made galcit 5 by 5 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at nominal mach number 5.8 phosphorescent lacquer technique used transition detection found to good agreement total-head rake measurements along plate surface pitot boundarylayer surveys found that boundary layer laminar at reynolds numbers at least 5 x 10 transverse contamination caused by turbulent boundary layer on tunnel sidewall originated far downstream flat plate leading edge at reynolds numbers 1.5 to 2 x 10, spread at uniform angle 5 compared to 9 degree low-speed flow effect two-dimensional local disturbances investigated technique air injection into boundary layer means hastening transition extensively used although onset transition occurred at reynolds numbers low 10, fully developed turbulent boundary layer not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10 regardless amount air injected qualitative discussion these results given emphasis on possibility greater stability laminar boundary layer hypersonic flow than at lower speeds direct skin-friction measurements were made by means floating element technique, over range reynolds numbers verified being laminar over complete range air injection, turbulent shear obtained only reynolds numbers greater than 2 x 10, value being good agreement earlier results investigation turbulent skin-friction coefficient found to approximately 0.40 that incompressible flow constant value r, 0.46 effective reynolds number between 5 6 x 10
